## [Version Control with Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123)

It was extremely interesting. The narrator in videos gave a playful tone for the course, it had a very pleasant way of telling information and had a lot of useful advices that were told from personal experience. Also answered a lot of questions I had to git in general.

## [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org)

This is something new for me. I've never seen such level of interactiveness, and it was really usefull to understand some aspects of remote work with git, since it's hard to get just by reading text. Animated infographics usually help me understand such things.

## [Git за 30 хвилин](https://codeguida.com/post/453)
1. The new thing I learned is that you can revert specific files to a specific commit state by using _git checkout_ command.
2. The thing that surprised me is that git has it's own graphical tool for viewing differences in files with _git difftool_ command.
3. I'm definitely using this difftool, it's useful.

## (7 Useful Git Tips for Beginners)[https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/git-tips/]
For some reason this article appears empty for me.

## (About Merge Conflicts)[https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-merge-conflicts]
1. New thing for me was that GitHub has it's own tool for addressing merge conflicts that involve changes on similar lines.
2. Nothing was surprising for me, since I already learned about merge conflicts.
3. I guess I will use this GUI tool by GitHub in future.

## (Resolving a Merge Conflict)[https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line]
1. The whole situation about commiting an already deleted file was new, because in previous tutorials only the similar-line-changes situation was described.
2. I was surprised by the fact, that VSCode by default is able to handle merge conflicts with similar line changes. It has built in buttons that allow you to leave either new or old versions of lines and remove git's special characters in just 1 click.
3. I will use the VSCode's merge conflict solver tool in future.

## (Communicating using Markdown)[https://i.imgur.com/4qFt6Ao.png]
This course added a lot of information to my Markdown knowledge. I find this language briliant, considering how easy it is to use it and how much can you achieve. 

## (Learn anything front-end)[https://learn-anything.xyz/web-development/front-end]
I looked through this beautiful infographic and decided to skip it for now. I know some front-end principals, learned react, js and html/css. Definitely returning to this one in the future.

## (Typing club)[https://www.typingclub.com/]
Though I don't need this tutorial, as I have good enough touch typing, I still spent some time on it just because how satisfying the site is. I love animations and sounds of the typing machine.

## (Как учиться и справляться с негативными мыслями)[https://guides.hexlet.io/learning/]
There was nothing new for me, since I agree with most of the points.
