## Linux CLI, and HTTP

This was an interesting course. I've had some experience with linux before, learning by myself a little and also had some lessons at the university. For me personaly, the permissions theme was dark and scary, but this course made it very simple and clear for me. These are important commands that will be definitely used by me in the future.

## Git Collaboration

Udacity course was really interesting. It answered some of the questions I asked myself after previous lessons and now I'm sure in the knowledge I got earlier.

Learngitbranching, in my opinion, is teaching git branching in the best way possible, allowing playing around and testing stuff even if it's not stated in the task. I'll definitely use it's playground to improve my skills of moving stuff around in the future.
